Assignment 7 for cs50 game dev course
Read and understand all of the Pokémon source code from Lecture 7.
Implement a Menu that appears during the player Pokémon’s level up that shows, for each stat, ‘X + Y = Z’, where X is the starting stat, 
Y is the amount it’s increased for this level, and Z is the resultant sum. This Menu should appear right after the “Level Up” dialogue 
that appears at the end of a victory where the player has indeed leveled up.
